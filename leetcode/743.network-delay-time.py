# Testcase Example:  '[[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]]\n4\n2'
#
# You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given
# times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi),
# where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it
# takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
#
# We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes
# for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n
# nodes to receive the signal, return -1.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
# Output: 2
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
# Output: 1
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
# Output: -1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= k <= n <= 100
# 1 <= times.length <= 6000
# times[i].length == 3
# 1 <= ui, vi <= n
# ui != vi
# 0 <= wi <= 100
# All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)
