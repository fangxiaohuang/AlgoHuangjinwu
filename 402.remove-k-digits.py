#
# Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k,
# return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
# Output: "1219"
# Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219
# which is the smallest.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: num = "10200", k = 1
# Output: "200"
# Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output
# must not contain leading zeroes.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: num = "10", k = 2
# Output: "0"
# Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with
# nothing which is 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= k <= num.length <= 10^5
# num consists of only digits.
# num does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
#

                i += 2
            else:
                ans += num[i+1]
                i += 1
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                ans += num[k:]
                break
        return ans
